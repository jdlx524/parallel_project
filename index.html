        <h3>Team Members: [Your Name], [Partner's Name]</h3>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>We aim to implement a parallel cloth simulation using a Mass-Spring model. The simulation will run efficiently on GPUs using CUDA to accelerate computations. We will explore different parallelization strategies to optimize performance and scalability.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Cloth simulation is widely used in gaming, animation, and physical simulations. It involves computing forces for each mass point, integrating movement over time, and handling collision detection. A parallel implementation is necessary to handle high-resolution cloth in real-time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>The main challenges include optimizing memory access patterns, ensuring proper load balancing across threads, reducing synchronization overhead, and efficiently handling self-collision detection.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Resources</h2>
            <p>We will use CUDA-enabled GPUs for acceleration, Pygame for visualization, and existing physics-based references on cloth simulation. Our implementation will build on the starter code developed in Python.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Goals & Deliverables</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Implement a parallelized Mass-Spring Model for cloth simulation.</li>
                <li>Optimize data access using shared memory and coalesced memory access.</li>
                <li>Explore different work scheduling strategies (static vs. dynamic).</li>
                <li>Visualize simulation results in real-time.</li>
                <li>Evaluate performance compared to a CPU-based implementation.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Platform Choice</h2>
            <p>We will use CUDA for parallel computation due to its ability to handle large-scale physics-based simulations efficiently. The computations map well to the GPU thread model, and memory access optimizations will be explored.</p>
        </div>
