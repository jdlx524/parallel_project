        <h2>Title</h2>
        <p>Optimized Parallel Computation for Large-Scale Data Processing</p>
        
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>We aim to develop an efficient parallel computing solution for processing large datasets using GPU acceleration. Our project will focus on optimizing performance using CUDA and OpenMP.</p>
        
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>This project is motivated by the need for faster data processing in scientific computing. We will implement and compare parallel solutions on different architectures.</p>
        
        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>The main challenges include workload distribution, minimizing memory bottlenecks, and optimizing synchronization overhead.</p>
        
        <h2>Resources</h2>
        <p>We will use CUDA-enabled GPUs, multi-core CPUs, and benchmarking tools. Initial implementations will be tested on AWS EC2 GPU instances.</p>
        
        <h2>Goals & Deliverables</h2>
        <p>Our primary goal is achieving a 10x speedup compared to a single-threaded implementation. We will also analyze power consumption and efficiency.</p>
        
        <h2>Platform Choice</h2>
        <p>CUDA and OpenMP are chosen for their support in high-performance parallel computing and compatibility with our target hardware.</p>
        
        <h2>Schedule</h2>
        <p>Week 1: Literature review and setup.<br>Week 2-3: Implementation of baseline algorithms.<br>Week 4: Performance tuning and optimization.<br>Week 5: Final evaluation and report writing.</p>
